# Visionist at Technica 2019 

At Visionist we embrace some of our nation’s most complex challenges. Since our inception we have provided the United States Intelligence Community with custom software solutions and analysis services. Everyday our team of engineers, designers, analysts and data scientists transform the way agencies make sense of their data. You may never hear of our work, but our solutions are used each day to keep our country safe.

## Our Challenges

### 1. Best Web Page

This challenge is geared towards young people who haven't had much experience with tech before. We've created a boilerplate application to help you get started on creating a web page using React JS. Your web page can focus on whatever content matter you're interested in. At Visionist, a well designed user interface and user experience is of high value. We're looking for what new tech you were able to use to create a visually appealing and easy to use page. You are not limited to our starter app. You can build from scratch or use any technology you prefer.

The starter app is located in the technica-starter-app folder in this repo. We've also created a guide for getting setting up our starter app [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oVsIbGW8uS4YcKlBgR00ltdb8tw5aX4VbE4h_mkZGP8/edit?usp=sharing). If you are unable to download the project or access the set up guide, we have USB drives to copy these resources directly to you. If anything is unclear, we're happy to help you get started.

If you're not sure what topic get started on, these are a few that we thought might be interesting.
- How to stay safe online
- 'About me' personal page

### 2. Best Combination of Data Sets

This challenge is for folks with a bit more experience in tech. We've prepared groups of data sets that we think might combine into interesting results. We want to see what you can come up with by combining two or more different data sets. You can use the data from our groups or any data sets you find. You can showcase data analytics, data visualizaiton, a web app, a game, or anything tech-related that you can come up with. Don't just display the data given; show us something new and interesting. Turn text documents into some kind of visual model or newfound, easy to understand conclusions or correlations.

The data sets are located in the Datasets folder in this repo. If you are unable to download data sets, we have USB drives to copy data directly to you.
