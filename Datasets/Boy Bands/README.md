## bands.csv

## boys.csv

-     **What is this?**: This file contains appearance information for the 234 boyband members that were featured in the band's music video in their highest ranking/earliest song (See the `highest_song_vid` column of the `bands.csv` file to see the video referenced for each group).
- **Source(s)**: Data was collected manually by watching each music video and recording characteristics about each members' hair, clothing, skin tone, accessories, and instruments. Each boyband member was reviewed by two people and any discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer. Since music videos typically involve several outfit/accessory changes, reviewers were instructed to describe the band members when all members were featured together in the same shot (a typical situation for boy band music videos).
