## mars-weather.csv

-     **What is this?**: Data representing the weather conditions on Mars from Sol 1 (August 7, 2012 on Earth) to Sol 1895 (February 27, 2018 on Earth).
- **Source(s) & Methodology**: This data was measured and transmitted via the [Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS)](https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/instruments/environsensors/rems/) on-board the [Curiosity Rover](https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/). The data was made publicly available by [NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/) and the [Centro de Astrobiología (CSIC-INTA)](http://www.cab.inta.es/es/inicio). The Centro de Astrobiología offers a widget and a disclaimer regarding the data collected by Curiosity [here](http://cab.inta-csic.es/rems/wp-content/plugins/marsweather-widget/widget.php?lang=en). You can also find more in-depth weather reports from the Centro de Astrobiología team [here](https://cab.inta-csic.es/rems/category/weather-reports/).

CAB will take no responsibility for any result or publication made base on the content of this file. To access REMS scientific data, visit [PDS](http://pds.nasa.gov). The environmental magnitudes given in this file are obtained from the values read by the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) on board the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover on Mars. This file provides the environmental magnitudes at REMS location, so MSL rover influences those magnitudes (rover position, rover temperature, rover orientation, rover shade, dust depositions on the rover, etc.) REMS does not take measurements continuously and it takes measurements at different times from one day to another. This fact has influence on the variation of the values given in this file from one day to another . For different reasons (instrument maintenance, instrument calibration, instrument degradation, etc.), some or all of the magnitudes in this file may not be available.
